# Beginner

Create a Tic Tac Toe game (mobile or web) and deploy it on Microsoft Azure. Get your creative juices flowing and try something different using Microsoft logos, rival football teams, just to name a few. 

Hack Requirement: Microsoft Azure

Hint: Start off thinking of the logic of a Tic Tac Toe game! It may take a lot of if/else statments but once you got it, its good.

# Intermediate 

Create a translator (mobile or web) application, deploy it on Microsoft Azure, and use the Bing Translator API. You must incorporate 5 languages of your choice, such as: Spanish, Dutch, French, German, etc. in the hack. 

Hack Requirement: Bing Translator API, Microsoft Azure, Incorporates 5 Languages

Hint: The Bing Translator API is asyncronous, so when printing all five you may have some issues. The example prints all five fast, but they can all be seen on the console(so you may want to add that into your code. i.e console.log(..) ). Also be prepared to possibly use an array and a for loop



# Advanced 

Create a facial recognition application (mobile or web) that prints "Hello [USER NAME]" to screen using the Project Oxford API. 

Hack Requirement: Project Oxford API, Microsoft Azure
